  - Las vegas was an Oasis.
  - Being an oasis, it was a natural stopping place for travellers going
    from California to the east

  - Then the hoover dam was built, and bought business to bars, and houses of prostitution.
  - Then the electricity and the magnesium plant made Las Vegas grow as a city

  - The Kefauver Committee made anti-gambling nonsense, but Nevada legalised it
  - So Las Vegas became the go-to place for gamblers kicked out of other states

  - Also, Bugsy Siegel

  - Until Atlantic City opened in 1976, Nevada was the only place in the United States where you could legally gamble. 
  - Its proximity to Hollywood and southern California made it a popular weekend getaway, and Vegas became an adult resort.
  - With that the demand for everything grew and the city grew.
