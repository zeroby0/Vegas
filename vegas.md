  - Las vegas was an Oasis.
  - Being an oasis, it was a natural stopping place for travellers going
    from California to the east

  - Then the hoover dam was built, and bought business to bars, and houses of prostitution.
  - Then the electricity and the magnesium plant made Las Vegas grow as a city

  - The Kefauver Committee made anti-gambling nonsense, but Nevada legalised it
  - So Las Vegas became the go-to place for gamblers kicked out of other states

  - Also, Bugsy Siegel

  - Until Atlantic City opened in 1976, Nevada was the only place in the United States where you could legally gamble. 
  - Its proximity to Hollywood and southern California made it a popular weekend getaway, and Vegas became an adult resort.
  - With that the demand for everything grew and the city grew.

Then the Mafia arrived, and started many Casinos, and started the Casino culture.
Soon, Mafia was removed from Vegas, and the Casinos were siezed and handed over to corporations.
